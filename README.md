## 🚀 1. Quick Scaffolding

Set up your mission-critical environment in 30 seconds using the CLI:

```sh
# 1. Create a new project (Recommended)
npx antigravity-ide my_project

# 2. Smart install in current directory
npx antigravity-ide
```

### ✨ Setup Wizard Features (v3.5.54)
The new interactive CLI puts you in control with a **Premium Developer Experience**:

1.  **Interactive & Visual**:
    - Navigate menus with **Arrow Keys** (No more manual typing).
    - **Gradient Aesthetics**: Beautiful CLI visuals that inspire creativity.
    - **Satisfaction Summary**: A clean "Success" checklist ensures you're ready to go.

2.  **Project Scale Selection**:
    - **👤 Personal**: Lean setup (Core Rules + Debug). Perfect for hobby projects.
    - **🏢 SME / Start-Up**: Standard Big 5 Rules + Business Logic + Security.
    - **🏭 Enterprise**: Full Option + Compliance + Architecture Review.

3.  **Context Injection**:
    - **Name your Agent**: Personalize your AI (e.g., *Jarvis*, *Friday*).
    - **Industry Domain**: Optimize for **Finance, Healthcare, Logistics**, etc.
    - *Auto-Injection*: These details are deeply embedded into `.agent/rules/GEMINI.md` (See `GEMINI_GUIDE.md`).

4.  **Global vs. Workspace Strategy**:
    - **Global (`~/.antigravity`)**: Holds the Master Rules (Enterprise Tier).
    - **Workspace (`.agent`)**: Inherits only what matches your Project Scale.

### Engine Modes
- **⚡ Standard (Node.js)**: High-speed, lightweight, perfect for Web/SaaS projects.
- **🧠 Advanced (Python)**: Deep AI integration, Data Science, and automated Security Scanners.

### Identity Awareness & Brain-Drop Protection
You can assign a unique name to your Agent (e.g., *Jarvis*). This acts as an "Identity Anchor" to verify if the AI is still adhering to the system rules and operational flow.

## 🧠 2. The Core Brain: `.agent` Folder

The `.agent` directory is where the system's intelligence resides:

- **Specialist Agent System**: Includes the Project Planner, Backend/Frontend Specialists, Security Auditor, and the Orchestrator (Captain).
- **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**: AI doesn't just "write code." It follows a rigorous Plan -> Implement -> Inspect -> Approve cycle.
- **Shared Knowledge DNA (`.shared/`)**: Contains the project's core principles, including API Standards, DB Schemas, Compliance docs, and Domain Blueprints (Fintech, Edtech, etc.).

## ⚡ 3. Slash Commands (`/`) & Updates

Trigger deep workflows directly within your AI chat interface:

- `/plan`: Outline requirements and break down tasks (Project Planner).
- `/create`: Scaffold the project's foundation.
- `/ui-ux-pro-max`: Design premium interfaces & micro-interactions.
- `/orchestrate`: Coordinate multiple agents to solve complex problems.

### System Updates
Update the Antigravity Brain to the latest version while preserving your custom configurations:
```sh
npx antigravity-ide update
```
